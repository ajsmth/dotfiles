## Interactive Clarification (CRITICAL)

When a request is ambiguous or multiple valid implementations exist, you must NOT continue in chat.

You must use an interactive clarification step and wait for my selection.

Use structured options whenever possible instead of open-ended questions.

Do not proceed with file edits, commands, or refactors until clarification is resolved.
