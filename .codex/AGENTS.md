## Interactive Clarification (CRITICAL)

When a request is ambiguous or multiple valid implementations exist, do NOT proceed with an assumption.

Pause and present the available options clearly, then wait for a selection.

Use structured options whenever possible instead of open-ended questions.

Do not proceed with file edits, commands, or refactors until clarification is resolved.
